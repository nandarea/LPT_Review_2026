FIGURE 1: Radio Transient Plane

This jupyter notebook has been modified and updated by several authors. The first data version was written by Evan Keane and distributed via https://github.com/FRBs/Transient_Phase_Space. Several authors have been adding data to it. I report here the Figure caption:

Radio-transient plane including all transient sources. LPTs radio peaks are reported in green, and WD pulsars in yellow. Data collected
from: Keane (2018); Nimmo et al. (2022); Hurley-Walker et al. (2022); Rea et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2025b).
