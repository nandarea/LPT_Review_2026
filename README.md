FIGURE 1: Radio Transient Plane.<br>
This figure has been modified and updated by several authors. We have collected them all and created a jupyter notebook. The first data version was written by Evan Keane and distributed via https://github.com/FRBs/Transient_Phase_Space. The jupyter notebook version has been first reported in Rea et al. 2022 (with great help of PhD student Celsa Pardo). I report here the Figure caption: "Radio-transient plane including all transient sources. LPTs radio peaks are reported in green, and WD pulsars in yellow. Data collected from: Keane (2018, Nature Astronomy, 2, 865); Nimmo et al. (2022, Nature Astronomy, 6, p. 393); Hurley-Walker et al. (2022, Nature, 601, 526); Rea et al. (2022, The Astrophysical Journal, 940, 72); Wang et al. (2025, Nature, 642, 583).

FIGURE 3: Period-Period Derivative diagram. <br>
Computef for all pulsar classes (including magnetars, XDINSs and CCOs) and LPTs overplotted for comparison (note
for most LPTs their spin-down are probably not due solely to dipolar losses, as for pulsars). The oblique lines represent different configurations of the pulsar death lines: the dashed lines correspond to the theoretical death-lines for a pure dipole, dotted lines for a twisted dipole, and the solid lines for the twisted multipole configuration (Chen and Ruderman, 1993, The Astrophysical Journal, 402, 264; Zhang et al., 2000, The Astrophysical Journal, 531, L135).

FIGURE 10: Distribution of periodicities for LPTs, WD pulsars, and some magnetic CVs.  <br>
Assuming all systems as WD binaries (possibly not true), we plot LPT periodicities along with some of the known polars and all intermediate polars under the WD binary scenario. The grey shaded region represents the CV “period gap”. Note that for most LPTs, the nature of the radio periods is unknown, here we are assuming them as spin periods if shorter than a few hours, and orbital periods if longer, but it is just an assumption assuming all systems are WD binaries. Hence please use the plot and relative discussion with the due uncertainties.
